Basic analyses:
● Genome assembly with PacBio reads.
● Assembly evaluation.
● Structural and functional annotation.
● Synteny comparison with a closely related genome.
● Reads preprocessing: trimming + quality check (before and after)
● RNA-Seq reads alignment against the assembled genome.
● Differential expression analysis between rich medium and heat-inactivated serum
conditions.
Extra analyses:
● Genome assembly with Illumina and Nanopore reads.
● Assembly evaluation (extra methods).
● Plasmid identification.
● SNP calling.
● Evaluate antibiotic resistance potential.
● Identify essential genes for growth in human serum based on the Tn-Seq data
analysis.
